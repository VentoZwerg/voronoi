# Voronoi Diagram Generator

This project generates an interactive 2D colored Voronoi diagram with random points. The diagram supports customizable numbers of points (2–100) and colors (2–20, capped at the number of points), with regions colored to match their corresponding points. The interface includes toggles for point and boundary visibility, sliders for adjusting the number of points and colors, and a button to regenerate the diagram. Evenly distributes colors (black, white, and random unique colors) with randomized remainder assignment are guaranteed.

## Implementations
- Browse the repo subdirectories for different implementations (Python, JavasScript, Electron), all on Linux, Windows and macOS.
- Refer to the README.md within for specific build/run instructions.
- Easy starting point: Check out the `browser` directory.

## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by computational geometry, art, and interactive visualization techniques.
